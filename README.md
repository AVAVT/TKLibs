# TKLibs

This is a package of utilities mostly for my personal use.

- Math extension methods for some Unity's structures (`ExtensionMethods`)
- `CurvableValue`: value interpolation using Unity's `AnimationCurve` (so it can be configurated in Editor)
- Weighted random
- Some Unity editor extensions: string dropdown, conditional hide etc
